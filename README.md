# cybersecurity-task_1
This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the Cybersecurity Internship. The goal of this task was to perform a basic network reconnaissance by scanning my local network using Nmap to discover active hosts and open ports, and then assess potential security risks.
Key Highlights:

->Local network scanned using TCP SYN scan (nmap -sS)

->Identified open ports on devices within 192.168.1.0/24

->Analyzed scan results and researched vulnerabilities

->Provided security recommendations based on findings

->Report and screenshots included

Tools Used:
Nmap (port scanning)
Wireshark (optional, for deeper packet inspection)
