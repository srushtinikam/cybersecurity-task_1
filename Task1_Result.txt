CYBERSECURITY TASK 1: SCAN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK FOR OPEN PORTS

OBJECTIVE:
Identify open ports on devices within the local network using Nmap and optionally analyze traffic with Wireshark.
This helps in understanding network exposure and basic reconnaissance techniques.

TOOLS USED:
- Nmap (https://nmap.org) – for port scanning
- Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org) – optional, for packet analysis
- Windows Terminal / Linux Terminal

Result:

I scanned the local IP range 192.168.1.5/24 using a TCP SYN scan. Here's what I found:

192.168.1.1
Host is up

Open Ports:

53/tcp → domain (likely DNS)

80/tcp → http

443/tcp → https

MAC Address: 20:0C:86:E6:05:88 (GX India Pvt)

Interpretation:
This is most likely the router or gateway device, as it’s hosting DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS services.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

192.168.1.2
Host is up

All 1000 ports closed

Interpretation:
The device is active but not offering any visible services over TCP — could be a secure/idle device.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

192.168.1.5 (My Own Device)
Host is up

Open Ports:

135/tcp → msrpc

139/tcp → netbios-ssn

445/tcp → microsoft-ds

5357/tcp → wsdapi

MAC Address: 92:34:C1:DD:15:A7 (Unknown)

Interpretation:
These ports are related to Windows networking (RPC, SMB file sharing, Web Services for Devices), suggesting this is a Windows machine — likely the one used for scanning.
