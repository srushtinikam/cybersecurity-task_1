CYBERSECURITY TASK 1: SCAN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK FOR OPEN PORTS

OBJECTIVE:
Identify open ports on devices within the local network using Nmap and optionally analyze traffic with Wireshark.
This helps in understanding network exposure and basic reconnaissance techniques.

TOOLS USED:
- Nmap (https://nmap.org) – for port scanning
- Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org) – optional, for packet analysis
- Windows Terminal / Linux Terminal

STEPS PERFORMED:

1. Find Local IP Range:
   - Used the command: ipconfig (on Windows)
   - Identified IP range: 192.168.1.0/24 (example)

2. Run TCP SYN Scan:
   - Executed: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
   - The -sS option performs a stealth TCP SYN scan.
   - Result: Discovered active hosts and open ports.

3. Save Scan Results:
   - Command used: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt

4. Analyze Scan Results:

   Device: 192.168.1.1
   - Open Ports: 53 (domain), 80 (http), 443 (https)
   - MAC Address: 20:0C:86:E6:05:88
   - Interpretation: Likely router or gateway

   Device: 192.168.1.2
   - All ports closed
   - Interpretation: Secure or idle device

   Device: 192.168.1.5 (My PC)
   - Open Ports: 135, 139, 445, 5357
   - MAC Address: 92:34:C1:DD:15:A7
   - Interpretation: Windows machine with file-sharing enabled

7. Identify Potential Security Risks:

   Device: 192.168.1.1 (Router/Gateway)
   - Port 53 (DNS): Risk of spoofing or amplification if misconfigured.
   - Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted traffic, vulnerable to MITM attacks.
   - Port 443 (HTTPS): Secure, but depends on SSL/TLS configuration.

   Device: 192.168.1.2
   - All ports closed – Minimal risk.

   Device: 192.168.1.5 (My PC)
   - Port 135 (MSRPC): Risk of remote code execution.
   - Port 139 (NetBIOS): May leak system information.
   - Port 445 (Microsoft-DS): Common ransomware target (e.g., WannaCry).
   - Port 5357 (WSDAPI): Exposes device discovery features.

RECOMMENDED SECURITY ACTIONS:
- Close unused ports using a firewall or router settings.
- Disable SMBv1 (obsolete and vulnerable).
- Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.
- Keep systems and software updated regularly.
- Limit service exposure to trusted IP ranges only.
